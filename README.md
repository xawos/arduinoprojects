Lcd Multimeter (LOFR)

-Distance using a HC-SR04

-Ohmeter using a voltage divider circuit

-Capacitometer using another voltage divider

-Shows results on a LCD 16*2

-Switches through functions using a single pushbutton



I've used this kind of setup with just 1 pushbutton due to the lack of pins on my Arduino UNO clone.
